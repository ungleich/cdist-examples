#   file:   /opt/NetApp/snapdrive/snapdrive.conf
#   Version 5.1 (Change 1826429 Built 'Mon Oct  1 06:14:33 PDT 2012')
#
# Default values are shown by lines which are commented-out in this file.
# If there is no un-commented-out line in this file relating to a particular value, then
# the default value represented in the commented-out line is what SnapDrive will use.
#
# To change a value:
#
#     -- copy the line that is commented out to another line
#     -- Leave the commented-out line
#     -- Modify the new line to remove the '#' and to set the new value.
#     -- Save the file and exit
#     -- Also remember to restart the snapdrive daemon by issuing 'snapdrived restart'
