This type is used to install netapp hostutilities on hosts with fc - adapter.

It installs all needed .so files without installing the emulex or qlogic kit.

Please take a look on the files/.gitignore file to examine which files 
you need to drop into the files folder.

Most of the files could be collected from a host where 
the toolkits are installed.

Also the netapp hostutilities rpm needs to be copied in the files folder.

Example usage:

    __sfs_netapp_hostutilities --version 6.2.212.1387
